# VARIABLES #

# Instruct make to warn us when we use an undefined variable (e.g., misspellings).
MAKEFLAGS += --warn-undefined-variables

# Define the default target:
.DEFAULT_GOAL := all

# Define the `SHELL` variable to avoid issues on systems where the variable may be inherited from the environment.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   We use `bash` so that we can use `pipefail`.
#

# [2]: http://clarkgrubb.com/makefile-style-guide
SHELL := bash

# Define shell flags.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   `.SHELLFLAGS` was introduced in GNU Make 3.82 and has no effect on the version of GNU Make installed on Mac OS X, which is 3.81.
# -   The `-e` flag causes `bash` to exit immediately if a `bash` executed command fails.
# -   The `-u` flag causes `bash` to exit with an error message if a variable is accessed without being defined.
# -   The `pipefail` option specifies that, if any of the commands in a pipeline fail, the entire pipeline fails. Otherwise the return value of a pipeline is the return value of the last command.
# -   The `-c` flag is in the default value of `.SHELLFLAGS`, which must be preserved, as this is how `make` passes the script to be executed to `bash`.
#
.SHELLFLAGS := -eu -o pipefail -c

# Remove targets if its recipe fails.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   Mentioning this target anywhere in a Makefile prevents a user from re-running make and using an incomplete or invalid target.
# -   When debugging, it may be necessary to comment this line out so the incomplete or invalid target can be inspected.

# RULES #

#/
# Default target.
#
# @example
# make
#
# @example
# make all
#/
all: install

.PHONY: all

#/
# Installs project dependencies.
#
# @example
# make install
#/
install: install-node

.PHONY: install

#/
# Install node module dependencies.
#
# @example
# make install-node

# Runs the project's cleanup sequence.

# Prints the runtime value of a `Makefile` variable.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   The rule uses the following format:
#
#     ```bash
#     $ make inspect.<variable>
#     ```
#
# @example
# make inspect.ROOT_DIR
#
# @example
# make inspect.CC
#/
inspect.%:

#/
# Asserts that a `Makefile` variable is set.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   The rule uses the following format:
#
#     ```bash
#     $ make assert.<variable>
#     ```
#
# -   If a variable is **not** set, the recipe exits with a non-zero exit code.
#
# @example
# make inspect.CXX
#/

		echo "\nError: You must set the environment variable: ${*}.\n"; \
